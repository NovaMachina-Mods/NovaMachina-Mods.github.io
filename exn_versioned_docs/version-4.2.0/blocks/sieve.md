# Sieve

The sieve is how you get most of your resources. Pretty much everything can be obtained by sifting a block in the sieve. You will need to place a mesh in the sieve before you can use it.

Multi-sieve sifting can be accomplished by placing other sieves nearby on the same Y-level. A sieve that is activated will attempt to use other sieves in a configurable radius.

## Usage

To place a block in the sieve, simply right click the sieve with the block that you want to sift. Continue right clicking until the block is gone to obtain your resources.

:::info
The sieve is hard locked to about two and a half clicks per second.
:::
:::caution
Once a block is partially sieved it is stuck in the sieve until you finish sifting.

## Meshes

Meshes are used to obtain resources from the sieve. Different meshes have different drop chances. General rule of thumb is the more it costs to make a mesh, the better chances to drop resources.

| Mesh    | Recipe                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| String  | ![](./image/mesh_string.png)  |
| Flint   | ![](./image/mesh_flint.png)   |
| Iron    | ![](./image/mesh_iron.png)    |
| Diamond | ![](./image/mesh_diamond.png) |

## Results

Resources are droppped at different rates depending on the mesh used. Some resources can only be dropped from specific meshes. It is also possible for some resources to drop multiple times from the same sieving action as a result of having multiple drop rates.
