## Formatting
Docusaurus was used to generate this documentation. If you add a new document please use Markdown syntax (either md or mdx).

Use spaces to indent instead of tabs.

All links should have their location specified at the bottom of the page. Internal links should all have their root at `/docs`.

If you need help understanding formatting, check out the source files of any of the current pages.
