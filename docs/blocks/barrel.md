# Barrel

The barrel has a wide range of uses. You can use it to compost organics into dirt, transform one fluid into another, transform a fluid into a block with an item, and spawn mobs. When in the rain, the barrel will collect water.

Wood barrels cannot accept hot fluids. Stone barrels can accept hot fluids. Water has a temperature of 300. Anything over 433 will not go into a wood barrel.

## Usage

Right click the barrel to get a block out of the barrel. Right click the barrel with a bucket to add or remove a fluid.

:::caution
Once a compost item is in the barrel, it cannot be removed. A barrel will void any fluid in it when it is broken.

## Fluid Transformation

The combination of some fluids and blocks will interact and transform the fluid in the barrel. The barrel must be full of the input fluid and the block placed directly below the full barrel.

| Result Fluid | Input Fluid | Block    |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Sea Water    | Water       | Sand     |
| Witchwater   | Water       | Mycelium |

## Fluid Block Transformation

When certain blocks or items are right clicked on a full barrel, the fluid will transform into a solid block consuming the block or item.

| Result Block          | Input Fluid | Input Item            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Brain Coral           | Sea Water   | Brain Coral Seed      |

| Tube Coral Wall Fan   | Sea Water   | Tube Coral Fan        |

## Fluid On Top

Filling the barrel with a fluid and placing another fluid in the block space above the barrel will result in the fluid in the barrel becoming solid.

| ------------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| Cobblestone  | Water           | Lava         |
| Obsidian     | Lava            | Water        |
